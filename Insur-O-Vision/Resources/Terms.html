<p class="p1">By downloading or using the HubOne app, these terms will automatically apply to you - you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the HubOne app. You're not allowed to copy, or modify the HubOne app, any part of the HubOne app, or our trademarks in any way. You're not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the HubOne app, and you also shouldn't try to translate the HubOne app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The HubOne app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Team One Adjusting Services, LLC.</p>
<p class="p1">Team One Adjusting Services, LLC is committed to ensuring that the HubOne app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the HubOne app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the HubOne app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you're paying for.</p>
<p class="p1">The HubOne app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It's your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the HubOne app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone's security features and it could mean that the HubOne app won't work properly or at all.</p>
<p class="p1">You should be aware that there are certain things that Team One Adjusting Services, LLC will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the HubOne app will require the HubOne app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Team One Adjusting Services, LLC cannot take responsibility for the HubOne app not working at full functionality if you don't have access to Wi-Fi, and you don't have any of your data allowance left.</p>
<p class="p1">If you're using the HubOne app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the HubOne app, or other third party charges. In using the HubOne app, you're accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the HubOne app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you're using the HubOne app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the HubOne app.</p>
<p class="p1">Along the same lines, Team One Adjusting Services, LLC cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the HubOne app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged - if it runs out of battery and you can't turn it on to avail the Service, Team One Adjusting Services, LLC cannot accept responsibility.</p>
<p class="p1">With respect to Team One Adjusting Services, LLC's responsibility for your use of the HubOne app, when you're using the HubOne app, it's important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Team One Adjusting Services, LLC accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the HubOne app.</p>
<p class="p1">At some point, we may wish to update the HubOne app. The HubOne app is currently available on Android &amp; iOS - the requirements for both systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the HubOne app to) may change, and you'll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the HubOne app. Team One Adjusting Services, LLC does not promise that it will always update the HubOne app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the HubOne application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the HubOne app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the HubOne app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>
